This repository contains the implementation of a neural network from scratch in Golang for educational purposes. The implementation is based on the article [Neural Networks from Scratch](https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-neural-networks/). To write the neural network, I created the library [NumGo](https://github.com/jnaraujo/numgo) for tensor manipulation and mathematical operations.
